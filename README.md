# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The program accepts user input containing both numbers and strings.
It uses a for loop to process each element and separates them into:
number_list
string_list
Empty strings are ignored.
Finally, based on personalization logic, one list is reversed.
# FEATURES
Takes number of elements as input
Accepts mixed data (numbers & strings)
Separates numbers and strings
Ignores empty strings ("")
Counts total numbers and strings
Applies personalized register number logic
Displays final output in required format
# PERSONALIZATION USED
Option A – Register Number Logic
If last digit of register number is even → Reverse number_list
If last digit is odd → Reverse string_list
Personalization ensures every student gets different output.
# SAMPLE OUTPUT
Numbers List: [40, 25, 10]
Strings List: ['Python', 'Loop']
Total Numbers: 3
Total Strings: 2
(Output varies based on register number.)
